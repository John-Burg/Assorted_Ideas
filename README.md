# Vegetable Project

## Preface

This project is the first independent project that I decided to create with Python. I wanted to create a simple project that exemplifies *some* of the concepts that I've learned so far in a fun way.

The aim of this simple project's code is to provide some objective information about a list of vegetables.

## Project Information

This project involves two arrays that, respectively, contain string data and numerical data. At the beginning of the project, the vegetable and vegetable_pricing variables are combined and printed to demonstrate an array with string data corresponding to numerical data. Next, some control flow is used to determine which vegetables are cruciferous vegetables. The vegetables that are not listed as cruciferous are read at their respective indices in the vegetable array and printed. Afterward, the total quantity of vegetables is printed.

Lastly, the final objectives of the project are to:

* determine the vegetables' subtotal
* calculate the 10.25% sales tax that applies to the vegetables' subtotal
* calculate the total amount of the five vegetables

The project ends with a printed statement specifying the vegetables' total price after tax.
